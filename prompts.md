## Firebase
I've built the front end for an app named "RoadWallet," which does the following:
  * Log travel expenses under categories
  * Add travelers to split costs and display each person's share
  * Show how much each traveler owes in real-time, as expenses are added
  * List and delete expenses

Write the code to store and manage the app's traveler and expense data using
Firebase's Realtime Database. Use my Firebase configuration and existing 
project code as a reference to get started:
  
```
```

Please include the entire JS code with detailed comments to help me understand it.
